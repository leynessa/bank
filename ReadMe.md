Transaction Purpose Classification
A complete machine learning system for classifying financial transactions based on their purpose text descriptions.
Overview
This project implements a text classification system that can predict transaction types (rent, groceries, utilities, etc.) based on transaction purpose descriptions. The system includes:

Data preprocessing and analysis
Multiple classical ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
Model comparison and evaluation
LLM approach demonstration (conceptual and partial implementation)
